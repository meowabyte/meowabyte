- [Fight Chat Control (fightchatcontrol.eu)](https://fightchatcontrol.eu/) - "The "Chat Control" proposal would mandate scanning of all private digital communications, including encrypted messages and photos. This threatens fundamental privacy rights and digital security for all EU citizens."
- [Hold Mojang Accountable For Their Unlawful Behaviour (YouTube Video With Update)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_UF_4gZclI) - Hold Mojang Accountable for actions such as Forceful Migration that made a lot of people lose access to their product, unnotified EULA changes and other shady practices they use.
- [Stop Killing Games (stopkillinggames.com)](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/) - ""Stop Killing Games" is a consumer movement started to challenge the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers. An increasing number of video games are sold effectively as goods - with no stated expiration date - but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends. This practice is a form of planned obsolescence and is not only detrimental to customers, but makes preservation effectively impossible. Furthermore, the legality of this practice is largely untested in many countries."
